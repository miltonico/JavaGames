A small elite group of Xpadder users are the first to try new features!

They use Xpadder daily and/or like hunting for bugs.
They understand how to handle crashes.
They know how to email screenshots.
They have been using Xpadder for a while so know what it should and should not do.
They want to be the best and get the top spot on the bug-hunter scoreboard.

If this sounds like you and you want to join the squad then email me at jonathan@xpadder.com
